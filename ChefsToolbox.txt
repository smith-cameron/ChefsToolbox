Overview: Application creates data base of ingredients cost breakdown and recipes. It imports db from exel spreadsheet (widely used in service industry) to get started and you can create more as you go. Recipe breakdown includes cost per unit of measure of the recipe(weight or volume), amount per serving, cost per serving and the final menu cost needed based on percentage of production cost. This is a bare bones version. There are many features that could be added later. MVP -
